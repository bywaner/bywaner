# Hi, I'm Waner 👋

I'm a doctoral scholar at the University of Sydney, researching how project management practices influence the sustainability and scalability of public health programs.

My work explores systems thinking, stakeholder coordination, and long-term impact in health, social, and volunteer-based initiatives. This space is where I quietly build — slow insights, light data work, and project reflections.

## 💡 Areas of Interest
- Project governance and delivery in public health
- Volunteer program systems and participation trends
- SDGs, sustainability, and evaluation
- Research methods and literature synthesis
- Python, Notion, GitHub for thought structure and learning

📍 You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/...)  
🧭 More to come as I continue building here.
